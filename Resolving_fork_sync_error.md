I faced this issue while creating a pull request in a repository under the Hactober fest .

If you've forked a repository and the original repository's managers change somethingfor instance adda new folder and you can't view it in your fork then follow the given steps.
     1)Click on 'Pull Request'
     2)Proceed to create a new pull request
     3)Now on the top bar you will see the base repository and head repository boxes.
     4)Interchange the repositories in the boxes i.e.change the base repository to yor forked repo and the head to the main repo.
     5)Commit
     
That should take care of the sync up!
